## Next Steps

1. Develop the customer management module
2. Implement the MOT reminder system
3. Create the invoicing functionality
4. Build the appointment scheduling system

## Resources Required

- Frontend developer (React/Vue.js)
- Backend developer (Python/Flask)
- Database designer
- UI/UX designer
- Testing resources

## Budget Considerations

- Development costs: £15,000-25,000
- Ongoing maintenance: £500-1,000/month
- Hosting costs (if cloud-based): £50-200/month
- Software licenses: £500-1,000/year

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Custom Development**: As outlined above, build a complete system from scratch
2. **Extend Existing System**: Add functionality to Garage Assistant 4 instead of replacing it
3. **Commercial Solution**: Purchase an off-the-shelf garage management system
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use GA4 for core data and integrate with specialized tools for invoicing, etc.

## Recommendation

Based on your needs, we recommend starting with the hybrid approach:

1. Use the GA4 Direct Access Tool for data access
2. Implement a custom MOT reminder system (highest priority)
3. Integrate with a commercial invoicing solution
4. Add customer management capabilities
5. Gradually replace commercial components with custom modules as requirements evolve
